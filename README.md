## Description

This project is on dimesionality reduction, feature selection, association analysis and anomaly detection on Carrefour datasets using R


## Context

Its not always easy for retailers to know what kind of items their customers buy. This is unfortunate because with this knowledge they would be able to better serve their clients. Thanks to association rules, a retailer can know what items clients buy together which can help them make marketing strategies like offering discounts to one of the items, only marketing one of the items or even placing them on the same shelf.
